# MyReads Project

This is the project made from Udacity's FEND course starter template. MyReads allows user to search books and categorize them into shelves. Project is made with Javascript library React. 

## Installing

Clone project from GitHub and to run app: 

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
